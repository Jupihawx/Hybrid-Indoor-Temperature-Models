## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository provides:
- Example temperature and velocity fields obtained from the simulations.  
- Sensor data and spatial configurations used for model validation.  

The goal is to facilitate transparency and reproducibility of the hybrid methodology that combines reduced-order modeling and physical constraints to simulate indoor air temperature distributions in air-conditioned environments.
